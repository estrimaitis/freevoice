## Features

- **Push-to-talk** - Hold the hotkey to record, release to transcribe
- **Hands-free mode** - Lock recording to speak without holding keys
- **System tray app** - Runs quietly in the background
- **Auto-type** - Transcribed text is automatically typed into the focused field
- **Smart Dictionary** - Automatically corrects brand names and technical terms
- **Text Cleanup** - Removes filler words (um, uh, etc.)
- **Multiple Whisper models** - Choose speed vs accuracy
- **Customizable shortcuts** - Set your own hotkeys
- **Notification sounds** - Audio feedback for recording start/stop
- **Offline** - Everything runs locally, no internet needed after model download
- **GPU acceleration** - Supports CUDA for faster transcription (optional)

## Quick Start

1. **Install Python 3.10+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **Download this repository** (Code → Download ZIP) and extract it

3. **Install dependencies** - Open terminal in the folder and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run freevoice** - Double-click `freevoice.bat`

That's it! The app will download the Whisper model on first run, then you're ready to go.

> **Note:** This is plain Python code - feel free to look around, customize it, or learn from it. No hidden magic here.

## Usage

1. **Start the app** - It appears in your system tray (bottom-right, near the clock)
2. **Click on any text field** where you want to type
3. **Hold your hotkey and speak** - Release to transcribe

### Default Shortcuts

| Action | Keys | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Push-to-talk** | Hold `Ctrl+Alt` | Hold to record, release to transcribe |
| **Lock recording** | `Ctrl+Alt` + `Space` | Hands-free mode - keeps recording after release |
| **Stop locked recording** | `Ctrl+Alt` | Stops recording and transcribes |
| **Cancel** | `Esc` | Cancels recording without transcribing |

All shortcuts can be customized in Settings.

### Tray Icon Status

The app icon shows a colored dot in the corner to indicate status:

| Dot | Status |
|-----|--------|
| (none) | Idle, ready to record |
| 🔴 Red | Recording (push-to-talk) |
| 🟣 Purple | Recording locked (hands-free) |
| 🟠 Orange | Processing/transcribing |

### Settings

Right-click the tray icon → **Settings** (or double-click the icon)

- **Model** - Choose Whisper model (tiny → large-v3)
- **Language** - Auto-detect or specify language
- **Shortcuts** - Customize all hotkeys
- **Text Cleanup** - Remove filler words automatically
- **Dictionary** - Add custom terms and brand names
- **Sounds** - Toggle notification sounds
- **Startup** - Launch automatically with Windows

## Whisper Models

| Model | Download | Speed | Accuracy | Best for |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| `tiny` | ~75 MB | Fastest | Basic | Quick notes |
| `base` | ~150 MB | Fast | Good | **Recommended** |
| `small` | ~500 MB | Medium | Better | General use |
| `medium` | ~1.5 GB | Slow | Great | Important content |
| `large-v2` | ~3 GB | Slowest | Excellent | Maximum accuracy |
| `large-v3` | ~3 GB | Slowest | Best | Maximum accuracy |

Models are downloaded automatically when first selected.

## Smart Dictionary

freevoice automatically recognizes similar-sounding words and replaces them with your preferred spelling. Just add your terms - no need to list every variation!

Edit in Settings → Dictionary, or directly in `dictionary.json`:

```json
{
    "terms": [
        "ChatGPT",
        "JavaScript", 
        "TypeScript",
        "PostgreSQL",
        "Kubernetes",
        "YourBrandName"
    ]
}
```

**How it works:**
- Say "chat gpt" → types "ChatGPT"
- Say "javascript" → types "JavaScript"
- Say "post gres" → types "PostgreSQL"

Uses phonetic matching - just add the correct spelling and it figures out the rest!

## Tips

- **Speak clearly** with natural pauses between sentences
- **GPU acceleration** - If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, transcription will be much faster
- **Set your language** - Specifying a language is faster than auto-detect
- **Clipboard preserved** - Your clipboard contents are restored after typing

## Troubleshooting

### "No audio recorded"
- Check your microphone is set as default in Windows Sound Settings
- Make sure no other app is exclusively using the microphone

### Slow transcription
- Use a smaller model (Settings → Model → tiny or base)
- If you have an NVIDIA GPU, ensure CUDA drivers are installed

### Text not appearing
- Make sure a text field is focused before releasing the hotkey
- Some applications may block simulated keyboard input
- Check tray menu → "Copy Last" to get the text to your clipboard

### Hotkeys not working
- Some apps may capture global hotkeys - try different shortcuts in Settings
- Run as administrator if shortcuts don't work in elevated apps
